# Kifu Viewer

Shogi (将棋) is a two-player strategy board game native to Japan, belonging to the same family as chess and xiangqi. Kifu (棋譜) is the Japanese term for abstract strategy game record.

Kifu Viewer is a desktop application which allows the loading of `kif` files and viewing shogi games.

*NOTE* that this application does not feature a shogi engine, thus the user cannot analyze games nor play against the computer.
